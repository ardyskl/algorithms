# # Thanks to anmourchen (https://github.com/anmourchen) for this short and efficient code
# compiled by ardy

# Please see and understand all the lectures before going through this solution
# We'll implement Prims minimum spanning tree algorithm, also known as Jarn√≠k's algorithm
# Prims used for finding the MST or minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph
# The total weight of all edges in the tree is minimised

# TASK 3: Jobs scheduling
'''
Your task is to run Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm on this graph.
You should report the total cost of a minimum spanning tree --- an integer,
which may or may not be negative.
'''
# the Data sets for all 3 Tasks are small enough for a straightforward O(mn) implementation of the algrothims using heaps can speed up efficiency even more
